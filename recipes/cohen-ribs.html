	<h3>Ingredients</h3>
	<ul>
		<li>2 tablespoons kosher salt</li>
		<li>2 tablespoons cracked black pepper</li>
		<li>1 tablespoon cinnamon</li>
		<li>1 rack baby back ribs</li>
		<li>2 teaspoons peanut or vegetable oil</li>
		<li>2 tablespoons garlic, chopped</li>
		<li>1/2 cup orange juice</li>
		<li>1/4 cup sweet soy (kecap manis)</li>
		<li>3 tablespoons sweet chili sauce</li>
		<li>1 teaspoon black sesame seeds, for garnish</li>
		<li>1 scallion, chopped, for garnish</li>
	</ul>
	<h3>Steps</h3>
	<ol>
		<li>Line a bamboo steamer basket with parchment paper and set the steamer in a wok. Add enough water to just
			touch the bottom rim of the steamer basket and bring the water to a boil. Cover the bamboo steamer with a
			lid.</li>
		<li>Mix together the salt, black pepper and cinnamon in a small mixing bowl and rub it all over the ribs.</li>
		<li>Cut the rack in half crosswise and lay the pieces in the steamer (it's ok if they overlap as long as the lid
			closes).</li>
		<li>Cover the steamer and steam the ribs until fork tender, about 1 hour, adding water to the wok as needed so
			the basket doesn't burn</li>
		<li>Remove the ribs and let stand until cool enough to handle. Cut the racks into individual ribs</li>
		<li>Drain and dry the wok and return to medium heat</li>
		<li>Add the peanut oil and garlic and cook until the garlic softens, about 2 minutes</li>
		<li>Pour in the orange juice, sweet soy and chili sauce and bring to a simmer</li>
		<li>Reduce the heat to medium low, add the ribs and cook, tossing frequently, until the ribs are glazed and the
			sauce is sticky, 8 to 10 minutes</li>
		<li>Transfer the ribs to a plate and garnish with the sesame seeds and scallions</li>
